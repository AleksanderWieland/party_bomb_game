# Party Bomb

Bomb is a party word game that involves saying words that contain a particle displayed on the device's screen.

There are currently 4 languages to choose from. The particles were found thanks to a Python script I created. I searched for collections of the most popular words in the languages in question, and the script divided them into parts having 2, 3 or 4 letters. The script recorded how many times the particle was at the beginning, middle or end of the word. I added the most popular particles to the application.

The game was created in Flutter.

The game was published on Google Play, but you can also play it in your browser!
